Description: Limit parallel build concurrency
 This package installs the "throttle" binary. It takes arguments that
 specify: the name of a lockfile, the number of concurrent invocations, and
 the program to execute and its parameters.
 .
 Throttle uses the lock file to block more than the specified number of
 concurrent throttle instance from executing the program and its parameters.
 Additional invocations of throttle block until existing invocations are
 complete.
